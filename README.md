# pairprog

This project has an [`Express`](http://expressjs.com) server setup with [`SocketIO`](https://socket.io) and we'd love to be able to have a chat app.

## Could you please

- Setup the chat
- Do a small front to show it off (basic html is fine but we'd love something a little more involved like `React`/`Vue`/`Angular`/`Svelte`/Whatever)
- Maybe add an admin access ? Just a fixed login/password
- Also, there is no way to compile/start the project ATM
- If you have time, we'd love some tests, whichever kind you prefer (we aim for 80% here at Hublo)
- If you still have time (:muscle:), could you either:
  - Dockerize the application
  - Store data in a DB (don't worry about security, we won't hold it against you)
- If you still have time (how?!), please grab a coffee with your interviewer :)
